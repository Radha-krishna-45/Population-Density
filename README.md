# Population-Density
This project developed a parallel algorithm in Java for processing US census data, utilizing Fork/Join framework to find corners and build a grid for population analysis. Algorithm versions were compared using experiments, including testing sequential cut-offs for parallelism. Various test cases were implemented to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
